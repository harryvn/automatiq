I extend my gratitude to the **[Selenium Community](https://www.selenium.dev/)** for their continuous efforts in maintaining and advancing the Selenium project. Their dedication and expertise have empowered automation testers to harness Seleniumâ€™s capabilities for web application automation. I am thankful for their ongoing commitment to keeping Selenium a vital and indispensable tool for the testing community.

Additionally, I sincerely appreciate **[Elemental Selenium](https://elementalselenium.com/) (a [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) product)** for offering the well-structured test website, **[The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)**, which has been invaluable for automation testers to practice and enhance their Selenium WebDriver skills. The site provides diverse scenarios and challenges, allowing us to showcase various automation techniques in this comprehensive documentation.

I would also like to thank the **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** team for creating a powerful and flexible documentation platform. Docusaurus has enabled us to build a robust and user-friendly documentation site for this project, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content. The customisation options and extensibility of Docusaurus have been instrumental in creating a high-quality documentation experience.
