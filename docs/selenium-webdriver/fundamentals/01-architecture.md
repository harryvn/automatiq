The Selenium WebDriver API is the core foundation of browser automation in Selenium. Before diving into advanced topics like waits, actions, or DevTools integration, it’s important to understand the building blocks of WebDriver.

This section covers the fundamental architecture of Selenium WebDriver — its interfaces, key classes, helper utilities, and how they interact. By exploring this foundation, you’ll gain a clear picture of how Selenium is structured under the hood, so you can use it more effectively in real-world automation.

The diagram below illustrates the core interfaces, classes, and relationships that form the foundation of the WebDriver API.
