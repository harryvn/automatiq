Selenium WebDriver is an open-source tool for automating web browsers. It provides a language-specific interface for browser automation, implementing the **[W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/)**. This protocol is a standard for browser automation, allowing Selenium to support multiple browsers and programming languages.

## Key Features:

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, enabling you to ensure compatibility across different browsers.

- **Programming Language Support**: Write tests in various languages such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, providing flexibility in choosing the language you are most comfortable with.

- **Integration**: Easily integrates with other tools like TestNG, JUnit, and Maven for a complete testing solution, allowing you to manage and execute your tests efficiently.

- **Community Support**: A large and active community that contributes to the development and support of Selenium, ensuring you have access to resources and help when needed.
